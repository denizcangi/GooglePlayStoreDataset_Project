# GooglePlayStoreDataset_Project
Sabanci University Fall 2019-2020 CS 210 Data Science Term Project

In the porject we used Google Play Store apps dataset which is provided from Kaggle. 
We used various machine learning algorithm to analyze the dataset. 
We used kNN Classifier, Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, Decision Tree Regressor. We used these methods to calculate mean absolute errors, mean square errors, root mean squared errors. We tried them to find the method for the dataset.
